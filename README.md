Submitted by: Medha Kuruganti

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- [X] Number of strikes that are left are shown
- [X] Changed the pattern to 5 buttons to easily show a win

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    
One of the challenges I faced when creating this submission was prioritizing what features I wanted to add. There was a lot I wanted to do and add even before I started the project, which was good for motivation but not for time management. With my busy schedule, it became a little hard to prioritize this project, so wanting to add a bunch of features before I even did the basic requirements was not conducive to getting the project done. With being excited about additional features, I wasn't being meticulous enough with writing my code (mainly when it come to making small syntax mistakes or fully understanding how to code the logic for the guess function or just forgetting to copy a line of code because it seemed so straightforward). 
I overcame this challenge by putting aside time on days I knew I had time to actually get it done. This allowed me to do however much I could in small periods of time without getting more involved than I could handle or the day. It also made me pay more attention to what I was doing, so even if it was code I was given, I could fully understand it rather than trying to rush to get to the more "fun" stuff. When I finally finished the required features, it was important that I picked features that wouldn't take too long. I would rather have a couple of features that allow me to use a couple of the skills learned through this project without spending all my time on one of them. This meant that I was unable to implement some of the features I found to be more interesting and challenging (mainly the countdown timer), but they are skills I may add in the future to use more Javascript. Some of the features I found to be too easy (like adding pictures to the buttons) seemed too easy and not enriching enough to implement as I have added images to divs before.
To summarize, a challenge that I faced in this submission was finding a balance between spending a lot of time on this project and being more interested in adding the additional features, and actually spending the time to understand the project while also accounting for other extracurricular and academic activities that I was busy with.

    

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    
I have a lot of questions about web development after completing my submission. In general, I feel like I don't know enough about web development, and I would love to actually learn more. However, more specifically, I wonder more about the backend for web development. I feel like I know a good amount about styling a page from prior experience, but where I lack knowledge is of integrating the backend and the frontend. This project was mainly frontend, which was nice because it allowed me to get more experience with Javascript and learn about libraries that I did not know of; however, I am more interested in going more in depth and creating a user-friendly web-page that uses databases or other information, while also using more interactive front-ends because I do not know how to do that.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely add all the optional features and style the page better. When doing the project, I wanted to be sure to add some of the optional features, but unfortunately time was not on my side, so features like the countdown (which seems very interesting to implement), had to take the backseat while I implemented some of the more straightforward features that I believed would show my skills well. In terms of style, I wish I had been able to do some nicer layouts. For example, I wanted to put the strike counter on the same line as the start/stop button and center the buttons more nicely on the page so they were more responsive. Ultimately, I would have been able to do these things had I had more time to experiment with different CSS features (namely the grid feature which I have used before). Also, had I had more time, I probably would have made it more aesthetically pleasing in terms of color palette and possibly images to make it look more professional or even just more fun, while also being easy on the eyes. One of my concerns with doing too much with the style without having time to think much about it is making it less disability friendly with brighter colors and making it harder to read/see certain things.
